# Exploring Distributed Erlang Behaviors With Docker

This repository contains several different implementations of Erlang systems running in a Docker environment. 

The objective is to understand how the language behaves in ("not-so much") corner cases which are not covered by the official documentation.

Folders servD, servDF, servDFR, servDFV contain the running example of the paper submitted for CONCUR2023. The paper contains instructions on how to run the examples and soon will be made public.
